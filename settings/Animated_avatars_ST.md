# Animated avatars in ST

Convert your video/GIF to APNG(animated png) format with the desired dimensions and place it on 'SillyTavern\data\default-user\thumbnails\avatar' with the name of the character you want to create, next you just create the character without an avatar, ST will copy the thumbnail into the main character folder(SillyTavern\data\default-user\characters) and embed the char description, then you can change the thumbnail if you dont want to load an APNG as thumbnail.
